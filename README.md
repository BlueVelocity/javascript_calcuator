# javascript_calcuator  
  
Basic calculator created using HTML, CSS & Javascript that can perform simple  
addition, subtraction, multiplication, & division operators on multiple inputs  
  
Character limit set to 25 digits to maintain container width  
  
This project was created at the start of my coding journey and includes some  
implementations that or suboptimal and may seem odd. Overall I'm happy with the  
project as it was an early attempt that yielded results and helped solidify  
some core concepts such as variables, functions, and loops.

This project is depricated and has been replaced with a calculator created as  
part of The Odin Project curriculum as seen here: 
[BlueVelocity Calculator](https://github.com/BlueVelocity/calculator)

Some features are not maintained between the projects as they vary in their  
desired product.
